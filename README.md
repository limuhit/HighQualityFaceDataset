We collect a high-quality image dataset that contains human faces. All the images are collected from the Flickr photo-sharing website. We select high-resolution images with high quality, downsample them by three times, and save them with the lossless image compression method PNG to remove possible compression artifacts. The dataset consists of two parts, i.e., the training set and the testing set.  The training set involves the images and the bounding boxes of faces in the images.  The testing set comprises high-quality images of 55 celebrities. For the test set, we offer the bounding box of the corresponding celebrity in the image. This dataset can be adopted to train and evaluate face image processing methods that require high-quality images.  The dataset is available at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1n7FKNkNxxOwkCzMV0FbnWw. Extract code: h5o3.
